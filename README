This repository contains software development tools contributed by the
community that are intended to facilitate and simplify the development
of MUMPS-based software.

The main author is Dr. Joel Ivey. Sam Habiel and Afsin Ustundag provided some
enhancements which were contributed back.

The tools included are:

 * Code Formatter, which prettifies M code so that it can be read easily.
 * Server side M Debugger routines which are used in conjuction with
   Eclipse M Plugin (XT\*7.3\*107 -- patch number reserved but not released).
 * Server side M Editing routines which are used with with Eclipse M Plugin;
   plus the Eclipse M Plugins to be used in Eclipse (XT\*7.3\*101 -- patch
   number reserved but not released).
 * Logging support for M code similar to Log4J. (XT\*7.3\*81 -- patch number
   reserved but not released). This patch also contains Unit Testing support
   for Mumps, but that has since been split off into its separete repository:
   https://github.com/joelivey/M-Unit.
